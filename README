This is test code to get AWS ElasticCache cleint code to correctly access a scaled Memcached cluster.

AutoClient.py tests an auto discovery client based on pymemcache HashClient which uses consistent hashing

ScaleRedis.py really scales Memcached and not Redis. The name is historic.
Every few minutes a Memcached server is alternatively added or removed from the cluster

The 2 modules should be run from an EC2 insatnce as  2 separate processes to test the system.
